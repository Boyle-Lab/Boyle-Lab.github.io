Melissaâ€™s PhD research focuses on understanding the regulatory capacity of the human non-coding genome. Her work involves both development of novel plasmid-based tools for assaying negative regulatory element activity and the leveraging of these tools to characterize regulatory elements in the 300kb non-coding genomic region surrounding the gene PRDM1.
