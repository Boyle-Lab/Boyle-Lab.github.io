Sheila has worked at the University of Calgary on medical genetics, at the University of Toronto on social ecology, at Toronto Western Hospital in a physiology lab and now in the Boyle lab at the University of Michigan on human genetics. Her future research interests vary, but include studying the pathogenesis of Parkinsons, head and neck cancers, and the development of cerebral organoids. A California native, Sheila has also grown up living in Alberta, Ontario, Michigan and Colorado and hopes to see more places as she continues her research.
