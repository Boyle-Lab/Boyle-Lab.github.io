An artist at heart, Vibha enjoys the creativity and impact that STEM allows her to have. She was a member of the University of Michiganâ€™s Girls Who Code chapter where she learned Python. Her capstone project focused on finding trends in HIV/AIDS across worldwide populations. A rising senior at Canton High School, Vibha is excited to pursue engineering as a career.
