Alan Boyle (Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, Human Genetics) completed his PhD in
Computational Biology and Bioinformatics at Duke University where he developed methods to map open
chromatin and his postdoctoral research at Stanford University where he developed new methods for
interpreting non-coding variation and worked as part of ENCODE and modENCODE. Currently, he works to
improve the interpretation of non-coding variation to extend from association to biological function and works
to map and characterize regulatory elements in the non-coding genome. He is PI of a U41 to annotate
regulatory variation and a PI of a NSF CAREER award to study the combinatorial effect of transcription factors
on gene regulation.
