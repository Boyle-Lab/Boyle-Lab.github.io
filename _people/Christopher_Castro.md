Christopher Castro received his bachelor's degree in applied mathematics from Northeastern Illinois University.  His PhD research targeted the role of genetic variation in autism spectrum disorders, with a particular focus on uninherited (de novo) mutations occurring in non-coding regions. He is currently a project manager in the Boyle Lab coordinating efforts between several University of Michigan DCMB labs and the IGVF (Impact of Genomic Variation on Function) Consortium.
