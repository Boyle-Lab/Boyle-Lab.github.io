<div class="Nheader">Research Computer Specialist &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="jobs/Computer_Specialist.pdf">[PDF]</a> </div>
<p>
A research computer specialist position is available in the laboratory of Dr. Alan Boyle in the Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics at the University of Michigan Medical School. This is a highly interdisciplinary lab focused on both genetic and epigenetic transcriptional regulation of genes. The applicant will be involved in leading defined research projects in bioinformatics with a focus on computational genomics.
<br><br>
This position is focused on development and implementation of new integrative analysis techniques with a focus on data generated using high-throughput sequencing technologies. Ideal applicants will have experience with eukaryotic genetics and current computational biology and bioinformatics methodologies. Additional responsibilities will include collaborating with undergraduate and graduate students working on multiple projects. Because the lab sits at the interface of computational and experimental work, the applicant should be capable of communicating with students and researchers in multiple disciplines.
<br><br>
The applicantâ€™s primary projects will be to (1) process, analyze, and manage large-scale sequencing datasets, (2) develop and maintain a web resource/database, and (3) assist in the development of new and formalizing of existing methods for general distribution and publication. More information on ongoing projects is available at http://BoyleLab.org/.
<br><br>
The successful applicant will be part of a cutting-edge research program with experience in large genomics studies and extensive opportunities for collaborations around the world. The lab focuses on the boundary between computational and experimental techniques and the applicant will have ample opportunity to work closely with bench research and novel datasets. 
<br><br>
Required Qualifications:<br><ul>
<li> Minimally a BA/BS in an appropriate computational or biological field and demonstrated experience in these areas 
<li> Experience with large datasets and cluster-computing
<li> Working with a linux operating system
<li> Proficiency in programming (ideally C/C++, Java, python, and/or R)
<li> Experience with perl is required
<li> Excellent organization and communication skills, collaborative spirit and strong personal motivation
</ul>
<br><br>
Desired Qualifications:<br><ul>
<li> Experience in molecular biology and genetics
<li> Full-stack web development experience
<li> Experience with Illumina sequencing data, especially RNA-seq
<li> Experience with SQL
<li> Experience with standard methods for genomic analysis
<br><br>
To apply, send a CV, cover letter describing your research experiences and ongoing research interests, and contact information for three references to Alan Boyle at apboyle@umich.edu.
<br><br>
Review of applications begins immediately. Applications will be considered until the position is filled. Please address any inquiries to Dr. Alan Boyle, at apboyle@umich.edu.
