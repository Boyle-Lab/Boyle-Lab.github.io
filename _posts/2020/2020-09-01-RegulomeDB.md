The Boyle Lab receives a <a href="https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=10024325&icde=52327424">U24 from the NHGRI</a> to support <a href="http://www.regulomedb.org/">RegulomeDB</a>! This is a multi-PI grant with Dr. Boyle and Michigan and Dr. Cherry at Stanford. The Human RegulomeDB project provides an essential resource that facilitates medical research and exploratory investigations of gene regulation. Researchers will be able to compare variants identified from personal genomes and large scale sequencing projects as well as GWAS studies to the wealth of information in RegulomeDB, and thereby rapidly gain knowledge of non-exomic information.
