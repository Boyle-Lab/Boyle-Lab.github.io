The Boyle Lab receives a predictive modeling grant from the NHGRI to support work on studying the impact of variation on cellular states. 
This project is part of the <a href="https://www.genome.gov/news/news-release/NIH-providing-185-million-dollars-for-research-to-advance-understanding-of-how-human-genome-functions">Impact of Genomic Variation on Function (IGVF)</a> consortium that is a $185 million dollar project across 30 different US research sites. Dr. Boyle leads the grant at Michigan along with co-investigators Ryan Mills, Maureen Sartor, Joshua Welch, and Jie Liu.
