Preston and Booker, UROP students in the Boyle lab for Winter 2021, have been earned a Blue Ribbon Award for their research project! Blue Ribbon Certificates were awarded for outstanding poster and presentation during the virtual symposium. Peer Facilitators nominated students whose visual representation of data was organized and well-designed and excelled in demonstrating the context of their research along with and learning about the project.
