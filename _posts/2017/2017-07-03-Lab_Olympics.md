The inaugural Boyle Lab Olympics was held July 3rd 2017 where the lab was split into two teams: Boyling Point (Alan, Jessica, Torrin, and Shengcheng) vs. The Hard Boyled Eggs (Adam, Sierra, Greg, Ningxin, and Christopher) and competed to win the ultimate DNA trophy. There were 8 events that tested both wet lab and dry lab skills. Special thanks to Haley who worked hard to organize and plan this entire day of activities!
<br><br>
<b>Event 1: Lab Mate Trivia and Baby Picture Identification</b><br>
Gold: Jessica | Silver: Alan | Bronze: Greg<br>
<br>
Teams then collaborated like scientists on the Lab Mate Trivia, and the Boyling Point was able to snag the W.<br>
<br>
<b>Event 2: Program Showgram </b><br>
Teams had to create a MadLibs program that was user-friendly and creative in 25 minutes. Since Alan did not respect the time limit, The Hard Boyled Eggs snatched the points. <br>
<br>
<b>Event 3: Science and UM Trivia</b><br>
This event tested the teamâ€™s breadth of knowledge, and while it was close, The Hard Boyled Eggs were able to pull ahead!<br>
<br>
<b>Event 4: Type Racer</b><br>
Individuals had to type both quickly and accurately in this challenge!<br>
Gold: Alan | Silver: Christopher | Bronze: Shengcheng (who had an accuracy of 99.7%!)
<br><br>
<b>Event 5: Shooting range</b><br>
The teams then competed in a rather difficult challenge where they had to dispense pipette tips into three different targets. We learned that Ningxin has a talent for this and was able to grab some points for The Hard Boyled Eggs.<br>
Gold: Ningxin | Silver: Sierra | Bronze: Alan <br>
<br>
<b>Event 6: Pipette tip bubble balance</b><br>
Individuals had to balance a drop of water onto a P20 tip, and while it was close, Ningxin was able to win the gold by balancing a 3.42 ul drop on the P20 tip!<br>
Gold: Ningxin | Silver: Shengcheng | Bronze: Adam<br>
<br>
<b>Event 7: Guess the Volume</b><br>
Each individual was given three containers to guess the volume with only their hands and eyes.<br>
Gold: Greg | Adam: Silver | Jessica: Bronze<br>
<br>
<b>Event 8: Three Legged Biohazard Bag Racing</b><br>
Each team had the change to prove their speed.. but the Boyling Point was able to win this round.<br>
<br>
When all the points were tallied, The Hard Boyled Eggs won the Boyle Lab Olympics of 2017. In order to bring the lab back together, there was a mystery final event in which the whole lab played Break Out. We were able to come back together and almost set the record in the Zombie Apocalypse escape room!
