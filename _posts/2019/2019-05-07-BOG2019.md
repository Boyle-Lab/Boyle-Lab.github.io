Members of the Boyle lab attended the Biology of Genomies 2019 conference at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York. Ningxin, Sam, Christopher and Torrin all presented posters of their current research projects. There was a lot of science talk, but they did manage to get out and enjoy the beautiful weather and scenary of Cold Spring Harbor.
