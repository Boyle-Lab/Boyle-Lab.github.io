Our algorithm developed by Shengcheng using RegulomeDB to help annotate functional non-coding variants outperforms all of the other algorithms in the CAGI 5 challenege. 
<br><br>
<a href="https://genomeinterpretation.org/">The Critical Assessment of Genome Interpretation</a> challenges are an annual competition designed to demonstrate the newest algorithms used to interpret variation throughout the genome.
<br><br>
Our group competed in the 'Regulation Saturation' Challenege that was focused on identifying how variants in regulatory elements (promoters and enhancers) can affect gene expression.
<br><br>
The lab attended the CAGI conference and presented our work to the other groups involved. Look for the paper shortly!
