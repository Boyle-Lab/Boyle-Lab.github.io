As a team-building activity, the lab took on the Minerva Part 1 escape room at Decode Ann Arbor. In almost record time, we put Minerva on the internet (oops), ranking in the top teams to have completed this escape room. We look forward to finding her in Part 2: Scavenger Hunt.

<div>
{% for image in site.static_files %}
    {% if image.path contains '2018-11-16-MinervaP1' %}
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ image.path }}" alt="image" />
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
</div>
