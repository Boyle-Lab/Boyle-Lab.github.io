Haley receives the Maas Professional Development Award! The Benard L. Maas Foundation Endowed Medical Fellowship Fund was established at the University of Michigan Medical School in 1989 to recognize and support outstanding students. This award is aimed at supporting professional development opportunities for our graduate trainees.

Haley received the award to support the Association for Women in Science (AWIS) professional development workshops and the Young Scientists' Expo, a program that pairs PhD students with middle school students to build a science fair project.
