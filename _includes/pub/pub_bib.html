  year = {2020},
  abstract = {Motivation: Aberrant DNA methylation in transcription factor binding sites has been shown to lead to anomalous gene regulation that is strongly associated with human disease. However, the ma-jority of methylation-sensitive positions within transcription factor binding sites remain unknown. Here we introduce SEMplMe, a computational tool to generate predictions of the effect of methyla-tion on transcription factor binding strength in every position within a transcription factor’s motif. Results: SEMplMe uses ChIP-seq and whole genome bisulfite sequencing to predict effects of methylation within binding sites. SEMplMe validates known methylation sensitive and insensitive positions within a binding motif, identifies cell type specific transcription factor binding driven by methylation, and outperforms SELEX-based predictions. These predictions can be used to identify aberrant sites of DNA methylation contributing to human disease. Availability and Implementation: https://github.com/Boyle-Lab/SEMplMe},

These included genes, biochemical regions associated with gene regulation (for example, transcription factor binding sites, open chromatin, and histone marks) and transcript isoforms. The marks serve as sites for candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) that may serve functional roles in regulating gene expression 1. The project has been extended to model organisms, particularly the mouse. In the third phase of ENCODE, nearly a million and more than 300,000 cCRE annotations have been generated for human and mouse, respectively, and these have provided a valuable resource for the scientific community.},

Here we summarize these efforts, which have produced 5,992 new experimental datasets, including systematic determinations across mouse fetal development. All data are available through the ENCODE data portal (https://www.encodeproject.org), including phase II ENCODE1 and Roadmap Epigenomics2 data. We have developed a registry of 926,535 human and 339,815 mouse candidate cis-regulatory elements, covering 7.9 and 3.4{\%} of their respective genomes, by integrating selected datatypes associated with gene regulation, and constructed a web-based server (SCREEN; http://screen.encodeproject.org) to provide flexible, user-defined access to this resource. Collectively, the ENCODE data and registry provide an expansive resource for the scientific community to build a better understanding of the organization and function of the human and mouse genomes.},

  abstract = {Transcription is tightly regulated by cis-regulatory DNA elements where transcription factors can bind. Thus, identification of transcription factor binding sites is key to understanding gene expression and whole regulatory networks within a cell. The standard approaches for TFBSs prediction such as position weight matrices (PWMs) and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) are widely used but have their drawbacks such as high false positive rates and limited antibody availability, respectively. Several computational footprinting algorithms have been developed to detect TFBSs by investigating chromatin accessibility patterns, but also have their limitations. To improve on these methods, we have developed a footprinting method to predict Transcription factor footpRints in Active Chromatin Elements (TRACE). Trace incorporates DNase-seq data and PWMs within a multivariate Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to detect footprint-like regions with matching motifs. Trace is an unsupervised method that accurately annotates binding sites for specific TFs automatically with no requirement on pre-generated candidate binding sites or ChIP-seq training data. Compared to published footprinting algorithms, TRACE has the best overall performance with the distinct advantage of targeting multiple motifs in a single model.},

However, 3D genome evolution and its relationship with natural selection remains largely unexplored. In mammals, the CTCF protein defines the boundaries of most chromatin loops, and variations in CTCF occupancy are associated with looping divergence. While many CTCF binding sites fall within transposable elements (TEs), their contribution to 3D chromatin structural evolution is unknown. Here we report the relative contributions of TE-driven CTCF binding site expansions to conserved and divergent chromatin looping in human and mouse. We demonstrate that TE-derived CTCF binding divergence may explain a large fraction of variable loops. These variable loops contribute significantly to corresponding gene expression variability across cells and species, possibly by refining sub-TAD-scale loop contacts responsible for cell-type-specific enhancer-promoter interactions.},

  abstract = {{Gene set enrichment (GSE) testing enhances the biological interpretation of ChIP-seq data and other large sets of genomic regions. Our group has previously introduced two GSE methods for genomic regions: ChIP-Enrich for narrow regions and Broad-Enrich for broad regions. Here, we introduce Poly-Enrich, which has wider applicability, additional capabilities and models the number of peaks assigned to a gene using a generalized additive model with a negative binomial family to determine gene set enrichment, while adjusting for gene locus length. As opposed to ChIP-Enrich, Poly-Enrich works well even when nearly all genes have a peak, illustrated by using Poly-Enrich to characterize pathways and types of genic regions enriched with different families of repetitive elements. By comparing Poly-Enrich and ChIP-Enrich results with ENCODE ChIP-seq data, we found that the optimal test depends more on the pathway being regulated than on properties of the transcription factors. Using known transcription factor functions, we discovered clusters of related biological processes consistently better modeled with Poly-Enrich. This suggests that the regulation of certain processes may be modified by multiple binding events, better modeled by a count-based method. Our new hybrid method automatically uses the optimal method for each gene set, with correct FDR-adjustment.}},

  abstract = {Zebrafish have been a foundational model organism for studying the spatio-temporal activity of genes and their regulatory sequences. A variety of approaches are currently available for editing genes and modifying gene expression in zebrafish including RNAi, Cre/lox, and CRISPR-Cas9. However, the lac operator-repressor system, a component of the E. Coli lac operon, has been adapted for use in many other species to study the inducible modulation of gene expression, but has not previously been shown to function in zebrafish. Here we demonstrate that the lac operator-repressor system robustly decreases expression of firefly luciferase in cultured zebrafish fibroblast cells. Our work establishes the lac operator-repressor system as a promising tool for the manipulation of gene expression in whole zebrafish. Additionally we show the first evidence that the cytomegalovirus (CMV) enhancer is active in zebrafish cells and enhances eGFP expression ubiquitously in zebrafish embryos. Our results lay the groundwork for the development of lac-based reporter assays in zebrafish, and add to the tools available for investigating dynamic gene expression in embryogenesis. We believe that this work will catalyze the development of new reporter assay systems to investigate uncharacterized regulatory elements and their cell-type specific activities.},

  abstract = {Comparative genomics studies are growing in number partly because of their unique ability to provide insight into shared and divergent biology between species. Of particular interest is the use of phylogenetic methods to infer the evolutionary history of cis-regulatory sequence features, which contribute strongly to phenotypic divergence and are frequently gained and lost in eutherian genomes. Understanding the mechanisms by which cis-regulatory element turnover generate emergent phenotypes is crucial to our understanding of adaptive evolution. Ancestral reconstruction methods can place species-specific cis-regulatory features in their evolutionary context, thus increasing our understanding of the process of regulatory sequence turnover. However, applying these methods to gain and loss of cis-regulatory features currently requires complex workflows which represent a potential barrier to widespread adoption by a broad scientific community. MapGL simplifies phylogenetic inference of the evolutionary history of short genomic sequence features by combining the necessary steps into a single piece of software with a simple set of inputs and outputs.},

A library of mutations covering all bases was generated by saturation mutagenesis and altered activity was assessed in a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) in relevant cell lines. Reporter expression was measured relative to plasmid DNA to determine the impact of variants. The challenge was to predict the functional effects of variants on reporter expression. Comparative analysis of the full range of submitted prediction results identifies the most successful models of transcription factor binding sites, machine learning algorithms, and ways to choose among or incorporate diverse datatypes and cell-types for training computational models.

However, a direct comparison of these diverse annotations is missing, and it is unclear how genetic variation within these annotations affects gene expression. Here, we compare five widely used annotations of active regulatory elements that represent high densities of one or more relevant epigenomic marks-"super" and "typical" (nonsuper) enhancers, stretch enhancers, high-occupancy target (HOT) regions, and broad domains-across the four matched human cell types for which they are available. We observe that stretch and super enhancers cover cell type-specific enhancer "chromatin states," whereas HOT regions and broad domains comprise more ubiquitous promoter states. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in stretch enhancers have significantly smaller effect sizes compared to those in HOT regions. Strikingly, chromatin accessibility QTL in stretch enhancers have significantly larger effect sizes compared to those in HOT regions. These observations suggest that stretch enhancers could harbor genetically primed chromatin to enable changes in TF binding, possibly to drive cell type-specific responses to environmental stimuli. Our results suggest that current eQTL studies are relatively underpowered or could lack the appropriate environmental context to detect genetic effects in the most cell type-specific "regulatory annotations," which likely contributes to infrequent colocalization of eQTL with genome-wide association study signals.},

However, part of the difficulty in translating findings from mouse is that, despite high levels of gene conservation, regulatory control networks between human and mouse have been extensively rewired. To understand common themes of regulatory control we look beyond physical sharing of regulatory sequence, where extensive turnover of individual transcription factor binding sites complicates cross-species prediction of specific functions, and instead look at conserved properties of the regulatory code itself. We define regulatory conservation in terms of a grammar with shared, species-specific, and tissue-specific segments, and show that this grammar is more predictive of shared chromatin states and gene expression profiles than shared occupancy alone. Furthermore, we demonstrate a marked enrichment of disease associated variation in conserved grammatical patterns. These findings offer new understanding of transcriptional regulatory mechanisms shared between human and mouse.},

To understand the genetic variation and biology underlying AF, we undertook a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 6,337 AF individuals and 61,607 AF-free individuals from Norway, including replication in an additional 30,679 AF individuals and 278,895 AF-free individuals. Through genotyping and dense imputation mapping from whole-genome sequencing, we tested almost nine million genetic variants across the genome and identified seven risk loci, including two novel loci. One novel locus (lead single-nucleotide variant [SNV] rs12614435; p = 6.76~{\texttimes} 10-18) comprised intronic and several highly correlated missense variants situated in the I-, A-, and M-bands of titin, which is the largest protein in humans and responsible for the passive elasticity of heart and skeletal muscle. The other novel locus (lead SNV rs56202902; p~=~1.54~{\texttimes} 10-11) covered a large, gene-dense chromosome 1 region that has previously been linked to cardiac conduction. Pathway and functional enrichment analyses suggested that many AF-associated genetic variants act through a mechanism of impaired muscle cell differentiation and tissue formation during fetal heart development.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:Transcription factors (TFs) form a complex regulatory network within the cell that is crucial to cell functioning and human health. While methods to establish where a TF binds to DNA are well established, these methods provide no information describing how TFs interact with one another when they do bind. TFs tend to bind the genome in clusters, and current methods to identify these clusters are either limited in scope, unable to detect relationships beyond motif similarity, or not applied to TF-TF interactions. METHODS:Here, we present a proximity-based graph clustering approach to identify TF clusters using either ChIP-seq or motif search data. We use TF co-occurrence to construct a filtered, normalized adjacency matrix and use the Markov Clustering Algorithm to partition the graph while maintaining TF-cluster and cluster-cluster interactions. We then apply our graph structure beyond clustering, using it to increase the accuracy of motif-based TFBS searching for an example TF. RESULTS:We show that our method produces small, manageable clusters that encapsulate many known, experimentally validated transcription factor interactions and that our method is capable of capturing interactions that motif similarity methods might miss. Our graph structure is able to significantly increase the accuracy of motif TFBS searching, demonstrating that the TF-TF connections within the graph correlate with biological TF-TF interactions. CONCLUSION:The interactions identified by our method correspond to biological reality and allow for fast exploration of TF clustering and regulatory dynamics.},

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) bring us closer to this goal by linking variation with disease faster than ever before. Despite this, GWASs alone are unable to pinpoint disease-causing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Noncoding SNPs, which represent the majority of GWAS SNPs, present a particular challenge. To address this challenge, an array of computational tools designed to prioritize and predict the function of noncoding GWAS SNPs have been developed. However, fewer than 40% of GWAS publications from 2015 utilized these tools. We discuss several leading methods for annotating noncoding variants and how they can be integrated into research pipelines in hopes that they will be broadly applied in future GWAS analyses.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag sequencing (ChIA-PET) is an established method for detecting genome-wide looping interactions at high resolution. Current ChIA-PET analysis software packages either fail to correct for non-specific interactions due to genomic proximity or only address a fraction of the steps required for data processing. We present Mango, a complete ChIA-PET data analysis pipeline that provides statistical confidence estimates for interactions and corrects for major sources of bias including differential peak enrichment and genomic proximity.Results: Comparison to the existing software packages, ChIA-PET Tool and ChiaSig revealed that Mango interactions exhibit much better agreement with high-resolution Hi-C data. Importantly, Mango executes all steps required for processing ChIA-PET datasets, whereas ChiaSig only completes 20% of the required steps. Application of Mango to multiple available ChIA-PET datasets permitted the independent rediscovery of known trends in chromatin loops including enrichment of CTCF, RAD21, SMC3 and ZNF143 at the anchor regions of interactions and strong bias for convergent CTCF motifs.Availability and implementation: Mango is open source and distributed through github at https://github.com/dphansti/mango.Contact: mpsnyder@standford.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {To broaden our understanding of the evolution of gene regulation mechanisms, we generated occupancy profiles for 34 orthologous transcription factors (TFs) in human-mouse erythroid progenitor, lymphoblast and embryonic stem-cell lines. By combining the genome-wide transcription factor occupancy repertoires, associated epigenetic signals, and co-association patterns, here we deduce several evolutionary principles of gene regulatory features operating since the mouse and human lineages diverged. The genomic distribution profiles, primary binding motifs, chromatin states, and DNA methylation preferences are well conserved for TF-occupied sequences. However, the extent to which orthologous DNA segments are bound by orthologous TFs varies both among TFs and with genomic location: binding at promoters is more highly conserved than binding at distal elements. Notably, occupancy-conserved TF-occupied sequences tend to be pleiotropic; they function in several tissues and also co-associate with many TFs. Single nucleotide variants at sites with potential regulatory functions are enriched in occupancy-conserved TF-occupied sequences.},

Although studies of individual elements and factors have explored similarities in gene regulation, a large-scale comparative analysis of basic principles of transcriptional regulatory features is lacking. Here we map the genome-wide binding locations of 165 human, 93 worm and 52 fly transcription regulatory factors, generating a total of 1,019 data sets from diverse cell types, developmental stages, or conditions in the three species, of which 498 (48.9%) are presented here for the first time. We find that structural properties of regulatory networks are remarkably conserved and that orthologous regulatory factor families recognize similar binding motifs in vivo and show some similar co-associations. Our results suggest that gene-regulatory properties previously observed for individual factors are general principles of metazoan regulation that are remarkably well-preserved despite extensive functional divergence of individual network connections. The comparative maps of regulatory circuitry provided here will drive an improved understanding of the regulatory underpinnings of model organism biology and how these relate to human biology, development and disease.},

Here, we use an approach to analyze TF colocalization within a cell type and across multiple cell lines at an unprecedented level. We extend this approach with large-scale mass spectrometry analysis of immunoprecipitations of 50 TFs. Our combined approach reveals large numbers of interesting TF-TF associations. We observe extensive change in TF colocalizations both within a cell type exposed to different conditions and across multiple cell types. We show distinct functional annotations and properties of different TF cobinding patterns and provide insights into the complex regulatory landscape of the cell.},

  abstract = {As the sequencing of healthy and disease genomes becomes more commonplace, detailed annotation provides interpretation for individual variation responsible for normal and disease phenotypes. Current approaches focus on direct changes in protein coding genes, particularly nonsynonymous mutations that directly affect the gene product. However, most individual variation occurs outside of genes and, indeed, most markers generated from genome-wide association studies {(GWAS)} identify variants outside of coding segments. Identification of potential regulatory changes that perturb these sites will lead to a better localization of truly functional variants and interpretation of their effects. We have developed a novel approach and database, {RegulomeDB}, which guides interpretation of regulatory variants in the human genome. {RegulomeDB} includes high-throughput, experimental data sets from {ENCODE} and other sources, as well as computational predictions and manual annotations to identify putative regulatory potential and identify functional variants. These data sources are combined into a powerful tool that scores variants to help separate functional variants from a large pool and provides a small set of putative sites with testable hypotheses as to their function. We demonstrate the applicability of this tool to the annotation of noncoding variants from 69 full sequenced genomes as well as that of a personal genome, where thousands of functionally associated variants were identified. Moreover, we demonstrate a {GWAS} where the database is able to quickly identify the known associated functional variant and provide a hypothesis as to its function. Overall, we expect this approach and resource to be valuable for the annotation of human genome sequences.},

  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies have been successful in identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms {(SNPs)} associated with a large number of phenotypes. However, an associated {SNP} is likely part of a larger region of linkage disequilibrium. This makes it difficult to precisely identify the {SNPs} that have a biological link with the phenotype. We have systematically investigated the association of multiple types of {ENCODE} data with disease-associated {SNPs} and show that there is significant enrichment for functional {SNPs} among the currently identified associations. This enrichment is strongest when integrating multiple sources of functional information and when highest confidence disease-associated {SNPs} are used. We propose an approach that integrates multiple types of functional data generated by the {ENCODE} Consortium to help identify "functional {SNPs"} that may be associated with the disease phenotype. Our approach generates putative functional annotations for up to 80\% of all previously reported associations. We show that for most associations, the functional {SNP} most strongly supported by experimental evidence is a {SNP} in linkage disequilibrium with the reported association rather than the reported {SNP} itself. Our results show that the experimental data sets generated by the {ENCODE} Consortium can be successfully used to suggest functional hypotheses for variants associated with diseases and other phenotypes.},

  abstract = {Transcription factors bind in a combinatorial fashion to specify the on-and-off states of genes; the ensemble of these binding events forms a regulatory network, constituting the wiring diagram for a cell. To examine the principles of the human transcriptional regulatory network, we determined the genomic binding information of 119 transcription-related factors in over 450 distinct experiments. We found the combinatorial, co-association of transcription factors to be highly context specific: distinct combinations of factors bind at specific genomic locations. In particular, there are significant differences in the binding proximal and distal to genes. We organized all the transcription factor binding into a hierarchy and integrated it with other genomic information (for example, {microRNA} regulation), forming a dense meta-network. Factors at different levels have different properties; for instance, top-level transcription factors more strongly influence expression and middle-level ones co-regulate targets to mitigate information-flow bottlenecks. Moreover, these co-regulations give rise to many enriched network motifs (for example, noise-buffering feed-forward loops). Finally, more connected network components are under stronger selection and exhibit a greater degree of allele-specific activity (that is, differential binding to the two parental alleles). The regulatory information obtained in this study will be crucial for interpreting personal genome sequences and understanding basic principles of human biology and disease.},

  abstract = {The human body contains thousands of unique cell types, each with specialized functions. Cell identity is governed in large part by gene transcription programs, which are determined by regulatory elements encoded in {DNA.} To identify regulatory elements active in seven cell lines representative of diverse human cell types, we used {DNase-seq} and {FAIRE-seq} to map "open chromatin." Over 870,000 {DNaseI} or {FAIRE} sites, which correspond tightly to nucleosome depleted regions, were identified across the seven cell lines, covering nearly 9\% of the genome. The combination of {DNaseI} and {FAIRE} is more effective than either assay alone in identifying likely regulatory elements, as judged by coincidence with transcription factor binding locations determined in the same cells. Open chromatin common to all seven cell types tended to be at or near transcription start sites and to be coincident with {CTCF} binding sites, while open chromatin sites found in only one cell type were typically located away from transcription start sites, and contained {DNA} motifs recognized by regulators of cell-type identity. We show that open chromatin regions bound by {CTCF} are potent insulators. We identified clusters of open regulatory elements {(COREs)} that were physically near each other and whose appearance was coordinated among one or more cell types. Gene expression and {RNA} Pol {II} binding data support the hypothesis that {COREs} control gene activity required for the maintenance of cell-type identity. This publicly available atlas of regulatory elements may prove valuable in identifying non-coding {DNA} sequence variants that are causally linked to human disease.},

were not assayed in previous studies based on microarrays. 
Differentially expressed tags within coding regions are enriched for 
gene functions involved in synaptic transmission, transport, oxidative 
phosphorylation, and lipid metabolism. Importantly, because {Tag-Seq} 
technology provides strand-specific information about all polyadenlyated 
transcripts, we were able to assay expression in noncoding intragenic 
regions, including both sense and antisense noncoding transcripts 
(relative to nearby genes). We find that many noncoding transcripts are 
conserved in both location and expression level between species, 
suggesting a possible functional role. Lastly, we examined the overlap 
between differential gene expression and signatures of positive 
selection within putative promoter regions, a sign that these 
differences represent adaptations during human evolution. Comparative 
approaches may provide important insights into genes responsible for 
differences in cognitive functions between humans and nonhuman primates, 
as well as highlighting new candidate genes for studies investigating 
neurological disorders.},

  abstract = {A subtelomeric region, 4q35.2, is implicated in 
facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy {(FSHD),} a dominant disease 
thought to involve local pathogenic changes in chromatin. {FSHD} 
patients have too few copies of a tandem 3.3-kb repeat {(D4Z4)} at 
4q35.2. No phenotype is associated with having few copies of an almost 
identical repeat at 10q26.3. Standard expression analyses have not given 
definitive answers as to the genes involved. To investigate the 
pathogenic effects of short {D4Z4} arrays on gene expression in the very 
gene-poor 4q35.2 and to find chromatin landmarks there for transcription 
control, unannotated genes and chromatin structure, we mapped 
{DNaseI-hypersensitive} {(DH)} sites in {FSHD} and control myoblasts. 
Using custom tiling arrays {(DNase-chip),} we found unexpectedly many 
{DH} sites in the two large gene deserts in this {4-Mb} region. One site 
was seen preferentially in {FSHD} myoblasts. Several others were mapped 
{\textgreater}0.7 Mb from genes known to be active in the muscle lineage 
and were also observed in cultured fibroblasts, but not in lymphoid, 
myeloid or hepatic cells. Their selective occurrence in cells derived 
from mesoderm suggests functionality. Our findings indicate that the 
gene desert regions of 4q35.2 may have functional significance, possibly 
also to {FSHD,} despite their paucity of known genes.},

  abstract = {Mapping {DNase} I hypersensitive {(HS)} sites is an accurate method of identifying the location of genetic regulatory elements, including promoters, enhancers, silencers, insulators, and locus control regions. We employed high-throughput sequencing and whole-genome tiled array strategies to identify {DNase} I {HS} sites within human primary {CD4+} T cells. Combining these two technologies, we have created a comprehensive and accurate genome-wide open chromatin map. Surprisingly, only 16\%-21\% of the identified 94,925 {DNase} I {HS} sites are found in promoters or first exons of known genes, but nearly half of the most open sites are in these regions. In conjunction with expression, motif, and chromatin immunoprecipitation data, we find evidence of cell-type-specific characteristics, including the ability to identify transcription start sites and locations of different chromatin marks utilized in these cells. In addition, and unexpectedly, our analyses have uncovered detailed features of nucleosome structure.},

  abstract = {The availability of genomic sequences from multiple bacteria has allowed global comparisons of patterns. Here we present a graphical comparison of normalized base frequencies in the vicinity of translation  starts for both eubacteria and archae. The results show that most eubacterial Open Reading Frames (ORFs) are preceded by a distinctly recognizable Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence pattern. However, some eubacteria deviate from this arrangement and have diminished SD patterns or completely lack this sequence. On the other hand, some archae seem to use both SD sequences and leaderless transcripts in their translation initiation  process. This is dependent on the position of a gene within an operon. Most archae seem to have other regular sequences located upstream from the typical SD location. Both eubacteria and archae have a surprising repetitive pattern seen within the averaged ORFs. The eubacterial and archaeal averaged patterns are slightly different from each other, and individual organisms within each domain vary from the averages. Nevertheless, the existence of such a periodicity within ORFs may allow the development of new techniques to identify actual genes from ORFs.},
