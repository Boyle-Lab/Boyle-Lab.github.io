			Understanding gene regulation at the transcriptional level is critical to understanding complex biological systems and human disease. In virtually 
			all organisms gene regulation is mediated by a “regulatory code” in which distinct combinations of specific transcription factors (TFs) 
			collaborate to regulate the expression of individual genes. This code is complex and not readily obvious from sequences alone. It likely involves 
			many cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) that exist both upstream and within genes. Data from the ENCODE and modENCODE projects suggests that the amount of 
			cis-regulatory sequence may exceed that of the genes themselves. In addition, mounting evidence suggests that major differences between individuals and
			species lies at the level of gene regulation and that changes in cis-regulatory sequences are responsible for these effects. As such, it is important 
			to map and understand how sequence variations in individuals are responsible for mediating differences in gene expression and their phenotypic 
			consequences. The goal of my research is to understand the biological mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation and how human variation at 
			regulatory regions affects this process.

	     Regulatory elements are much more difficult to identify than genes and likely account for more variation among individuals than actual coding 
	     differences in genes. We use high-throughput genome approaches to identify which regions of the genome are more likely to have some biological function. 
	     In particular, we are interested in those regions where transcription factors interact with the DNA and have some regulatory mechanism. 
	     We can identify these regions through a number of experimental assays (ChIP-seq, DNase-seq, ATAC-seq, etc.) as well as computational approaches.</font></p>
     <p class = "what_we_do_text"><font color = "#FFCB05">Integration of diverse genomic data: </font><font color = white>The vast amount of high-throughput genomic 
	     data available has presented an exciting challenge in the field of computational biology. We seek to integrate these data into a meaningful and 
	     interpretable annotation of the genome which allows for various tasks in computational biology such as prediction of regulatory networks, gene expression, 
	     and co-regulatory mechanisms.</font></p>
     <p class = "what_we_do_text"><font color = "#FFCB05">Characterization of regulatory regions in the human genome: </font><font color = white>Identifying and studying 
	     elements, including promoters, enhancers, silencers, and insulators, will lead to new therapeutic strategies as the complex regulatory networks are revealed. 
	     Up to now the characterization and validation of truly functional regulatory elements has been a low throughput endeavor as each regulatory site is cloned 
	     into a reporter assay and tested. We have developed a novel method that performs one of the most common validation assays, transient transfections, in a high-
	     throughput manner by combining it with an innovative sorting and sequencing system. This system, which has been shown to be practical and feasible, will allow 
	     for rapid and thorough identification of the method of action of regulatory elements throughout the human genome.</font></p>
     <p class = "what_we_do_text"><font color = "#FFCB05">Prediction of functional non-coding variants: </font><font color = white>Prevalence of whole-genome sequencing and 
	     high-quality annotations of the human genome has started to allow exploration of some of the mechanisms of gene regulation on an organismal scale in humans. 
	     Until recently, most efforts have focused on examining the effect of variation in protein coding regions on human phenotype. However, with the release of many 
	     whole-genome regulatory annotations, both biochemical and genetic, it has started to become possible to assign putative regulatory function to non-coding DNA. 
	     This is particularly significant as a majority of human variation associated with disease falls outside of gene bodies. We attempt to shed light on the effect 
	     of these differences by advancing several areas fundamental to human biology. We use computational approaches and functional -omic data and genetic data from 
	     the literature to: 1) Identify and predict which variants result in a direct impact on regulatory function through disruption of protein-DNA interactions, and 
	     2) Identify noncoding variants affecting human disease. We expect to be able to accurately predict the function of a large fraction of variation in the 
	     regulatory segments of the genome. </font></p>
    <p class = "what_we_do_text"><font color = "#FFCB05">A balance of computational and experimental work: </font><font color = white>In computational biology we are able to 
	    leverage many experimental datasets in order to inform our understanding of biology. However, we believe that many of these findings lack confidence without 
	    proper experimental validations. We seek to integrate computational work back into the lab to better inform both disciplines through an iterative approach. The 
	    success of this approach allows for the use of a wider array of available tools and testing methodologies.</font></p>
